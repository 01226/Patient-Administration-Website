Patient Administration Website

This repository contains the code for a patient administration website, a comprehensive application designed to enhance the efficiency of healthcare administration. The website offers a user-friendly interface for managing patient information and includes a secure login system. The backend is implemented using Django, while the frontend utilizes CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and jQuery for improved security and client-side validation.

The Patient Administration Website provides the following key features:

Patient Information Management: The application allows healthcare administrators to efficiently manage patient information. This includes creating new patient records, updating existing records, and deleting records when necessary.

Backend Implementation: The backend of the website is developed using Django, a Python-based framework. It provides a robust and scalable foundation for managing the data, implementing business logic, and ensuring secure interactions with the database.

User Authentication: The website includes a login system to authenticate users. Healthcare administrators can create user accounts, log in securely, and access the patient administration features based on their assigned permissions.

Frontend User Interface: The frontend is designed with a responsive user interface to ensure a seamless experience across different devices. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used to create an intuitive and visually appealing interface for managing patient information.
